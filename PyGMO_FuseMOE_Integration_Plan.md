## NOTES: (Updated)

*   The enhanced FuseMOE architecture integrates multimodal data (Time series, Text, Imaging, Signal, Custom like EEG/Weather).
*   **Preprocessing now includes an advanced imputation step (`src/preprocessing/advanced_imputation.py`) to handle missing values before model input.**
*   Evolutionary computing (PyGMO) is used for optimizing Experts (`src/core/evolutionary_experts.py`) and the Gating network (`src/core/pso_laplace_gating.py`).
*   MIMIC-IV processing involves specific scripts (`src/preprocessing/mimiciv_preprocessing/*`, `src/scripts/create_*_task.ipynb`).
*   Migraine prediction uses custom processors (`src/preprocessing/migraine_preprocessing/*`) and data pipeline (`src/preprocessing/migraine_preprocessing/migraine_data_pipeline.py`).
*   Execution is handled via scripts like `run_migraine.sh` or `run_pygmo_mimiciv.sh`, calling main scripts (`run_migraine_prediction.py`, `main_mimiciv.py`) which configure and run the `PyGMOFuseMoE` or `MigraineFuseMoE` models (`src/core/pygmo_fusemoe.py`).
*   Comprehensive visualization notebooks are planned for analyzing imputation, optimization, and prediction stages.
